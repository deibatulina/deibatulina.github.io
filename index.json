AI is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but is not necessarily limited to biologically plausible methods.\nFor 2021 , the researchers used the following classification of AI types:\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical AI that can not only reproduce the maximum of human abilities, but even surpass it. Those who believe in ASI believe that he will gain the power to penetrate a person’s thoughts and feelings in order to subordinate him to his will. See Supermind: horror stories of futurologists or the real future of artificial intelligence?\nThe strong or general AI (Artificial General Intelligence, AGI), which also remains hypothetical, is a step below ASI in terms of intelligence, adherents of this type of AI are limited in their beliefs by the possibility of creating machines capable of at least performing the same actions as a person.\nWeak, or narrow AI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence, ANI) allows you to see weak hints of intelligence in the behavior of machines (that’s why it is called weak). It is designed to run only a strictly defined narrow range of applications (that’s why it is called narrow). In the case of ANI, no autonomous behavior or independent development beyond human control is possible. Systems equipped with ANI can exist only in the form in which they were created by man and even theoretically cannot get out of his control.\nOutdated general definitions of artificial intelligence:\n(J. McCarthy) AI develops machines that have intelligent behavior; (Britannica) AI - the ability of digital computers to solve tasks that are usually associated with highly intelligent human capabilities; (Feigenbaum) AI - develops intelligent computer systems with capabilities that we traditionally associate with the human mind: language understanding, learning, the ability to reason, solve problems, etc.; (Elaine Rich) AI is the science of how to teach computers to do something in which a person is currently more successful. Intelligence (from Lat. intellectus — sensation, perception, understanding, understanding, concept, reason), or mind is a quality of the psyche consisting of the ability to adapt to new situations, the ability to learn and memorize based on experience, understanding and applying abstract concepts and using their knowledge to manage the environment. Intelligence is the general ability to cognize and solve difficulties, which unites all the cognitive abilities of a person: sensation, perception, memory, representation, thinking, imagination.\nIn the early 1980s, scientists in the field of computational theory Barr and Feigenbaum proposed the following definition of artificial intelligence (AI): “Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that develops intelligent computer systems, that is, systems with capabilities that we traditionally associate with the human mind - language understanding, learning, the ability to to reason, solve problems, etc.”\nLater, a number of algorithms and software systems began to be attributed to AI, the distinctive feature of which is that they can solve some problems the way a person thinking about their solution would do.\nThe main properties of AI are language understanding, learning, and the ability to think and, importantly, act. AI is a complex of related technologies and processes that are developing qualitatively and rapidly, for example:\nnatural language text processing machine learning; expert systems; virtual agents (chatbots and virtual assistants); recommendation systems. At what stage of development is artificial intelligence now? British scientist Stephen Hawking has often spoken about the development of artificial intelligence (AI) as the real reason for the possible destruction of the human race.\nIn April 2017, Stephen Hawking, during a videoconference in Beijing, held as part of the Global Mobile Internet Conference, said:\n“The development of artificial intelligence can become both the most positive and the most terrible factor for humanity. We must be aware of the danger it poses,” he stressed.\nAs the scientist said in his interview with Wired at the end of November 2017, he fears that AI may replace humans in general. According to Hawking himself, people can create too powerful artificial intelligence, which will be extremely good at achieving their goals. And if these goals do not coincide with human goals, then people will have problems, the scientist believes.\n","date":1684972800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684972800,"objectID":"1a9ff343943a655519cc754f03ffc0c8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82/","publishdate":"2023-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82/","section":"post","summary":"This article is dedicated to the term \"artificial intelligence\" and the level of its development in a modern world.","tags":["artificial intelligence","robots","technologies","high-tech"],"title":"Artificial Intelligence","type":"post"},{"authors":["Darya Ibatulina"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Last week’s post Monday We had one remote couple, at which I gave a report.

In this sense, C/C++ and Python can be considered scientific programming languages.\nIn a broader sense, a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized to use mathematical formulas and matrices. Such languages are characterized not only by the presence of libraries that perform mathematical or scientific functions, but also by the syntax of the language itself. For example, neither C++ nor Python have built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.); instead, this functionality becomes available through standard libraries. Scientific programming languages in a broader sense include ALGOL, APL, Fortran, J, Julia, Maple, MATLAB and R.\nScientific programming languages should not be confused with scientific language in general, which in a broad sense denotes higher standards of accuracy, correctness and conciseness expected from practitioners of the scientific method.\nExamples Linear algebra Scientific programming languages provide tools for working with linear algebra. For example, the following program in the Julia scientific programming language solves a system of linear equations:\nA = rand(20, 20) # A - матрица 20x20 b = rand(20) # b - вектор из 20 элементов x = A\\b # x - решение A * x = b Working with large vectors and matrices is a key feature of these languages, as linear algebra lays the foundation for mathematical optimization, which in turn provides basic applications such as deep learning.\nMathematical optimization In a scientific programming language, we can calculate the optimum of functions with a syntax close to a mathematical language. For example, the following Julia code finds the minimum of a polynomial\n$$ P(x,y)=x^2-3xy+5y^2-7y+3. $$\nиспользование Optim P(x,y) = x^2 - 3x*y + 5y^2 - 7y + 3 z₀ = [ 0.0 0.0 ] optimize(z -\u0026gt; P(z...), z₀, Newton(); ) This example uses Newton’s method to minimize. Modern scientific programming languages will use automatic differentiation to calculate gradients and hash values of a function given as input; cf. differentiable programming. Here automatic direct differentiation was chosen for this task. Old scientific programming languages, such as the venerable Fortran, would require the programmer to pass next to the optimized function a function that calculates the gradient and a function that calculates the Hessian.\nWith more knowledge of the function to be minimized, more efficient algorithms can be used. For example, convex optimization provides faster calculations when the function is convex, quadratic programming provides faster calculations when the function is maximally quadratic in its variables, and linear programming when the function is maximally linear.\n","date":1683334500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683334500,"objectID":"cb514bfcc7e97980857a61f64cb6d30a","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","publishdate":"2023-05-06T00:55:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","section":"post","summary":"Thank you for reading my blog.

If this is the first time you hear this phrase, then this article is definitely for you! So, a markup language (text) in computer terminology is a set of characters or sequences of characters inserted into a text to transmit information about its display or structure. Belongs to the class of computer languages. A text document written using a markup language contains not only the text itself (as a sequence of words and punctuation marks), but also additional information about its various sections — for example, an indication of titles, selections, lists, etc. In more complex cases, the markup language allows you to insert interactive elements and the contents of other documents into the document. It should be noted that the markup language is incomplete by Turing and is not usually considered a programming language.\nLogical and visual markup There are logical and visual markup. In the first case, we are talking only about what role this section of the document plays in its overall structure (for example, “this line is the title”). In the second, it determines exactly how this element will be displayed (for example, “this line should be displayed in bold”). The idea of markup languages is that the visual representation of a document should be automatically derived from logical markup and not depend on its immediate content. This simplifies the automatic processing of the document and its display in different conditions (for example, the same file may be displayed differently on a computer screen, mobile phone and print, since the properties of these output devices differ significantly). However, this rule is often violated: for example, when creating a document in an editor like MS Word, the user can highlight the titles in bold, but not indicate anywhere that this line is the title.\nExamples of markup languages Markup languages are used wherever it is required to obtain formatted text based on text alone: in typography (SGML, TeX, PostScript, RTF), computer user interfaces (Microsoft Word, OpenOffice), the World Wide Web (HTML, XHTML, XML, WML, VML, PGML, SVG, XBRL). Markdown is also quite common, which will be discussed further.\nMarkdown Syntax Formatting of text elements in Markdown:\nHeadings: To create a header, use the # sign (the number of lattices corresponds to the header level).\nType of font: Bold font (** on both sides). Bold + italics (*** on both sides).\nQuoting (\u0026gt;): A larger sign is placed and then a quote is written.\nLists:\nA bulleted (unordered) list (Denoting the list items with dashes or asterisks).\nEmbedding lists (using indents) before each sub-item.\nOrdered list (using numbers): 1.Item 1; 2. Item 2; 3. Item 3.\nTo nest one list into another, we also use indents.\nHyperlinks (the name of the link is written in square brackets, and the website is written in round brackets next to it).\nCode design (the code is designed with the symbols above and below):\nDesign of images: To insert an illustration into the text, you need to use the following syntax (!specify the name of the image) (Fig. @fig:001):\n{#fig:001 width=70%}\n","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"This article includes an information about markdown languages!","tags":["markdown"],"title":"Markdown languages.

I stayed at home, doing my homework again to free up the weekend for myself. And then I remembered that I was officially on sick leave and this day would not be considered truancy.\nWednesday March 8th! My friend and I went for a walk around the city, we were presented with a wonderful bouquet of tulips, we ate rolls and in the evening I went to the theater to see the play “Onegin”. The performance was truly gorgeous! I returned home late, immediately deciding that I would not go to the first couple on Thursday.\nThursday A miracle happened, and I went to the first couple! This day turned out to be great: the boys congratulated us on the last holiday, presented cupcakes and postcards.\nFriday In the morning I did my homework, and in the afternoon I went to the university for a speech on the Translator Module.

Git Version control. Git. Version control systems (VCS, vngl. VCS - Vesion Control Systems) are used when several people are working on a project. They allow you to roll back to previous versions of the project without losing new developments and changes made to the project. For example, the developers posted a new version of the project, but there were errors in it. In order not to lose changes and correct errors, thanks to version control systems, it is possible to return to the old, working version, and then eliminate the flaws.\nUsers, in turn, have the opportunity to see what exactly has changed and compare the new version with the old one. Developers see who and what changes have been made to the project, so that if anything happens, they know who to ask.\nOf course, you can simply copy the project to another directory, this approach is often used because of its simplicity, but it has many disadvantages:\nredundancy (all code is duplicated, not just changes); there are no mechanisms for distributing work between multiple developers; there is no data on what exactly has changed (usually they write a history file with general information about the changes). To solve some of these problems, local SLE has been developed. One of the first and most popular SLE of this type was RCS, which was developed in 1985. For each file registered in the system, it stores a complete history of changes, and for text files, an effective delta compression algorithm is used, when only the latest version and all interversion changes are stored. Such SLE solved only the first problem - data redundancy. Modern SLE can be divided into two groups: centralized and distributed.\nCentralized version control systems The next major problem was the need to collaborate with developers on other computers. To solve it, centralized version control systems (CSCs) were created. In such systems, for example, CVS, Subversion and Perforce, there is a central server on which all files are stored under versioning control, and a number of clients who receive copies of files from it. This has been the standard for version control systems for many years.\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local SLE. For example, everyone knows who and what is doing in the project. Administrators have clear control over who can do what, and, of course, it is much easier to administer the CSCS than local databases on each client.\nHowever, with this approach, there are several serious drawbacks. The most obvious one is that a centralized server is a vulnerable point of the entire system. If the server is shut down for an hour, then developers cannot interact for an hour, and no one can save a new version of their work. If the disk with the central database is damaged and there is no backup, you lose absolutely everything — the entire history of the project, except for a few working versions preserved on users’ working machines. Local version control systems are subject to the same problem: if the entire project history is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems And in this situation, distributed version control systems come into play. In systems such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs, clients do not just download the latest versions of files, but completely copy the entire repository (a repository, in the vulgar turnip, is a place where any data is stored and maintained). At the same time, it is possible to allocate a central repository (conditionally) to which changes from local ones will be sent and, with it, these local repositories will be synchronized. Therefore, in the case when the server through which the work was carried out “dies”, any client repository can be copied back to the server to restore the database. Every time a client picks up a fresh version of the files, he creates himself a full copy of all the data. In addition, in most of these systems, you can work with several remote repositories. To date, the de facto standard has become a distributed version control system - GIT, but in old large projects, outdated SLE may well occur (for example, Subversion, which was popular at the time).\nGIT Basics Almost all operations are local To perform most operations in Git, only local files and resources are needed, i.e. usually information from other computers on the network is not needed. For example, to show the project history, Git doesn’t need to download it from the server, it just reads it directly from your local repository. Therefore, you will see the story almost instantly. If you need to view the changes between the current version of the file and the version made a month ago, Git can take a month-old file and calculate the difference on the spot, instead of requesting the difference from the SLE server or downloading an old version of the file from it and making a local comparison. In addition, working locally means that almost everything can be done without network …","date":1678406400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678406400,"objectID":"718dcb4151d5c22d25cc6c87f60168b8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8.-git/","publishdate":"2023-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8.-git/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome!
